# 🌟 RAG Pipeline with BeyondLLM 🌟 #
Welcome to the RAG Pipeline with BeyondLLM project! This repository showcases a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built using the BeyondLLM framework. Whether you're exploring LLM (Large Language Model) applications or building intelligent systems capable of retrieving and generating human-like responses, this project offers a solid foundation.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a RAG pipeline, primarily focused on processing YouTube videos (in English) to generate meaningful insights and responses. With features like real-time query processing, user feedback integration, and advanced retrievers, this project stands out as a powerful tool for developers and AI enthusiasts.

## ✨ Features
- YouTube Video Processing: Extract and process content from YouTube videos, converting them into manageable data chunks.
- Advanced Retriever: Utilize advanced retrievers like cross-rerank to enhance retrieval accuracy.
- Language Model Integration: Leverage powerful LLMs, including the "Mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2" model from Hugging Face.
- User Feedback Mechanism: Gather user feedback to refine and improve generated responses.
- RAG Triad Evaluation: Implement RAG Triad evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated responses.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation
Follow these simple steps to get the project up and running:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Streamlit: For deploying the interactive application
## Installation
### 1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-pipeline-beyondllm.git
  cd rag-pipeline-beyondllm

### 2. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
### 3. Set up your API keys:
  Add your Hugging Face and Google API keys to the config.py file.
  HF_TOKEN = "your-huggingface-token"
  GOOGLE_API_KEY = "your-google-api-key"
### 4. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py
## 📜 Code Structure
Here's a brief overview of the key files in this project:

**app.py:** The main Streamlit application script. Handles data processing, querying, and user interactions.
**config.py:** Configuration file where you set your API keys.
**requirements.txt:** List of dependencies required to run the project.
**utils.py:** Contains utility functions used throughout the project.
## 💻 Usage
### 1. Processing a YouTube Video
Enter the URL of an English YouTube video into the provided text box.
Click Process Video to analyze and convert the video content into data chunks.
### 2. Querying the Model
Enter your query in the text box (e.g., "Which tool is mentioned in the video?").
Click Get Answer to receive a response generated by the language model.
### 3. Evaluating the Response
The response will be displayed along with RAG Triad evaluation metrics.
Provide feedback on the response quality to help improve future answers.
